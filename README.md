# Welcome to the VEX Library

This is a compilation of various libraries from third-parties as well as code made in-house to easily interact with VEX robots. The code is to be used with an Arduino and the Adafruit Motor Shield. This was made for New York University's Tandon School of Engineering Introduction to Engineering & Design (EG1003).
